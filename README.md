#Contacts Organizer

Web Application written in Java in Spring MVC using Tomcat 7 as a server.
Sql file contains database that is necessary for aplication to work. I used XAMPP/PHPMyadmin with standard configuration, but database source can be changed easily by modifying database.properties file which is stored in path 'ContactsOrganizerWebApp\src\main\resources\META-INF'.

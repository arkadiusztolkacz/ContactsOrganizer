#Contacts Organizer

Web Application written in Java in Spring MVC using Tomcat 7 as a server.
Sql file contains database that is necessary for aplication to work. I used XAMPP/PHPMyadmin with standard configuration, but database source can be changed easily by modifying database.properties file which is stored in path 'ContactsOrganizerWebApp\src\main\resources\META-INF'.

To open initial page, for example after running application with Tomcat server, input path into browser: localhost:Tomcat_port_number/contactsOrganizer

It's still under development.
TODO List:
- finish an interface which allows to add profile picture to every contact.
